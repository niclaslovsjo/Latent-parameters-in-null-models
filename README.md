# Latent-parameters-in-null-models

This repo implements parts(for now) of the method described in Tiziano Squartini and Diego Garlaschelli 2011 New J. Phys. 13 08300. Which deals with an analytical solution to find null models of network-data, as opposed to rewiring-schemes. 

Will update this later with more information.
